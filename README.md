# MapReduce-mushroom-naiveBayes

## Implementing a MapReduce version of naive Bayes


The purpose of this assignment is to implement a MapReduce version of Naive Bayes using pure Python. This code will then be used to classify the training set from a well-known data set, the mushroom data set.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroomLinks to an external site.

The data is attached to this assignment description.

Helper code and descriptions can be found in:

https://github.com/gmprovan/CS6423/blob/main/MapReduce_NaiveBayes.ipynb

Note that the helper code has been developed and will run in a standard computer Python interpreter, such as idle. If you want to use Google colab then you will have to adapt this appropriately.

Please write your code in Jupyter notebooks so you can generate your results in the notebook. The key result that I want to see is the performance of the classifier on the test set.
